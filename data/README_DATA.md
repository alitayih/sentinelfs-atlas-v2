# Data notes

- `world_countries.geojson`: real world country boundaries (Admin-0 style) sourced from the public `johan/world.geo.json` dataset (derived from Natural Earth low-resolution country outlines), normalized to include `properties.country_name` and `properties.iso_a3`.
- `demo_signals.csv`: synthetic daily signals for 150 days.
- `demo_exposure.csv`: synthetic exposure factors by country.
- `scenarios.json`: rule-based scenario definitions used by Scenario Simulation.

All non-geometry data files are demo/synthetic for product prototyping.
